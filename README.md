## Hello and welcome!

I am currently on my fourth year of the five year integrated Master's degree in Inudstrial Engineering and Management with a specialization in Data Science at Uppsala University. In my degree, thus far, I have been mainly focusing on business development and engineering, with touches of computer science and data analysis. For the last two years of the degree, I will be focusing on data science.

You can find the main deliverables for coding related university courses I've taken on Master's level in my [university-coding repo](https://github.com/alexandersundquist/university-courses), and the deliverables from independent courses I've taken to deepen my knowledge beyond my university courses in my [independent-coding repo](https://github.com/alexandersundquist/independent-courses).
