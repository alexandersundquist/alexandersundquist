## Hello and welcome!

I am currently on my fourth year of the five year integrated Master's degree in IndUstrial Engineering and Management with a specialization in Data Science at Uppsala University. In my degree, thus far, I have been mainly focusing on business development and engineering, with touches of computer science and data analysis. For the last two years of the degree, I will be focusing on data science.

### Repositories
- You can find the main deliverables for the coding related Master's courses I've taken in [university-courses](https://github.com/alexandersundquist/university-courses).
